# Back-End-JS

In this course we have created the project Cubicle workshop and after each lesson we have added and updated something new.
In part 1 we have managed to display the main layout and render the pages by using template library Handlebars, also create all the routes using Express.js and some simple actions like create a new cube.
In part 2 we have added NoSql database - MongoDB & Mongoose and we've created relations between the cubes and theit accessories.
In part 3 we have added authentications, users are able to register and log in, and if there are loged in users they are able to create new cubes, edit them and the finally to delet them.
